About
=====
This is a panel and plasmoid for Plasma 5 which is trying to implement a
mac style effect for its applets. It uses the Now Dock plasmoid
for its configuration and complements it as one single area
for which the user can add its applets. The applets as the user
windows are going to create a nice zoom effect on hovering.

Installation
============

- **Notice:** First uninstall any locally installed now dock components by using the **uninstall-local.sh** script
