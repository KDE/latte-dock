//! What is the importance of this class?
//!
//! This window is responsible to identify if the mouse is still present
//! in the REAL FLOATING GAP between the VIEW and the SCREEN EDGE.
//! When VIEWS are REAL FLOATING then the VIEW Window is really placed
//! as it is shown to the user. In that case we need a way to check
//! where the mouse is even though it is OUTSIDE the VIEW or the
//! SCREENEDGEGHOSTWINDOW. The main functionality of FloatingGapWindow
//! is that it is TEMPORARILY shown/draw after a MUSTHIDE signal of
//! VisibilityManager was sent; in order to check if the mouse is still
//! inside the FLOATINGGAP. After it has really identified where mouse
//! is present, an FloatingGapWindow::asyncContainsMouse(contains) signal
//! is sent.
